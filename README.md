Web/PDF Scrapers I've built through the years that have helped me automate real-life tedious processes. All these scrapers work are currently still working :)

jobsitescraper.py Scrapes a job site and saves all their job postings into dataframes and then CSV. 

imagesitescrapping.py accesses a popular forum and scrapes all the images posted there and downloads and sorts into folders.
